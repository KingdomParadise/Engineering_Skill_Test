# Engineering_Skill_Test

Explanation
The original function is rather complex with multiple levels of conditionals and seemingly unnecessary repetitions of code. The purpose of the function is to generate a deterministic partition key based on an event.

In the refactor, I've simplified the code by removing the redundant if (candidate) block and using a ternary operator to return either the trivial partition key or the hashed value if the candidate string is too long. Additionally, I've extracted the hash creation into a separate function for readability and reusability.

This refactor results in cleaner, more concise code that accurately captures the intent of the original function while being easier to understand and maintain.
